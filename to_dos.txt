# TODO: Could possibly let the player decide where to initiate its pawn
# TODO: Change action space to be only the moves and not the cases -> Possibly 8**2 for move direction and build
# TODO: Changes the state representation to be 5x5x4 (board) and 5x5x1 (players)

# TODO AS OF MARCH 20:
- Pit to fix
- Player to fix (ordre)
- Logic to check (9 in arena sometimes)
- SOmeone wins even though it was supposed to be the other (SantoriniGame)
- Fix arena (qui qui recoit le nouveau Net et qui qui gagne)
- COnfirm if action space is ok -> Maybe linked to invalid moves
- Validate training by going in Pit if it beats random player


- CLean-up code
